Dynamical Methods for Finding Node Influence in Boolean networks
=======================================================

Code to analyze node influence in Boolean and discrete-state networks.  

See network_influence.ipynb for code to calculate node influence in various genetric regulatory networks (GRNs) using different dynamical methods, including the generalized threshold network (GTN).

Notebooks and scripts will be added shortly.

The corresponding paper is in preparation.
